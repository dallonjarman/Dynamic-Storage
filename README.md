# Dynamic-Storage
This was created for CYB136 - Secure Design 2
I created a mock dynamic storage program. The purpose of this is to dynamically allocate memory to the userâ€™s name and to use constructors to store the names.
The reposotory contains the working C++ and a broken. The purpose of the broken is to exploit a bug and show what would happen when you are not careful about writing secure code.
